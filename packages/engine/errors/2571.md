You need to narrow down the type of the variable before accessing its properties or assigning it to a different typed variable. For example:

```ts
const foo: unknown = "bar";

if (typeof foo === "string") { // Now I know 'foo' is of type 'string',
  const baz: string = foo;     // I can assign it to a typed variable
  foo.toUpperCase();           // and access its properties
}
