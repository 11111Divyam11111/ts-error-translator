  The file "next/image" only exports a single entity, which is exported by default.
  You must have written 'export default {component};' somewhere, which means that this particular file exports only this 'component'.
  Thus, whenever you are going to import this component into some other file, you must write:
  import component from 'next/file'.

  However, if you write it as:
  import {component} from 'next/file',
  it would mean that this component from this file is a named export.
  A named export means that a file already has a default export, and the 'component' you are trying to import is exported by other means.

  So, in our case, this error arises because the file "next/image" is exporting the Image as a default export, not as a named export.
  Therefore, we must import it as:
  import Image from 'next/image'.

'{1}' is not one of the things exported from '{0}'. Did you mean to import '{1}' from '{0}' instead?
