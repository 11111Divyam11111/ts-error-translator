excerpt: "Object has the same property multiple times"

I expect objects to have unique property names.

Because this object has a duplicate property, I don't know how to deal with it:

```ts
const dish={
  name:"Mom's spaghetti",
  chef:"Eminem",
  delicious:false,
  delicious:true
}
```

I'll be happy again if you remove the duplicate like so:

```ts
const dish={
  name:"Mom's spaghetti",
  chef:"Eminem",
  delicious:true
}
```
