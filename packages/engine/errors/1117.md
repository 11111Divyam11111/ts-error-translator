original: "An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name."
excerpt: "Object has the same property multiple times"

I expect objects to have unique property names, like this one:

```ts
const dish={
  name:"Mom's spaghetti",
  chef:"Eminem",
  delicious:true
}
```

This object has a duplicate property, so I don't know how to deal with it:

```ts
const dish={
  name:"Mom's spaghetti",
  chef:"Eminem",
  delicious:false,
  delicious:true
}
```
