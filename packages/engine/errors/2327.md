original: "Property '{0}' is optional in type '{1}' but required in type '{2}'."
excerpt: "Property '{0}' in type '{2}' cannot be 'undefined'."

You're assigning to a variable whose type `A` matches `B` but `B` has a property which can be `undefined` whereas `A` disallows it. For example:

```ts
interface Foo {
  {0}?: string
}
interface Bar {
  {0}: string
}
const foo: Foo = { value: "" }
const bar: Bar = foo
```

Types `Foo` and `Bar` are structurally equal because they have the same properties. However, they're incompatible because the property `{0}` can be `undefined` in `Foo` but not in `Bar`.
