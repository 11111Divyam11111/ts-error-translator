original: "Class name cannot be '{0}'"
excerpt: "You can't give a class the name of '{0}' because it's protected by TypeScript."

```ts
class {0} {
}

You should name your classes to something which is not a typescript type. Checkout types here, [Everyday Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)
