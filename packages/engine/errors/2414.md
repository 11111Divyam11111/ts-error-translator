Instead of naming your classes based on typescript types,

```ts
class any{
}
```

or 

```ts
class string{
}
```

or

```ts
class number{
}
```

You should name your classes to something which is not a typescript type. Checkout types here, [Everyday Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)
