excerpt: "Two object types that look-alike have a property '{0}' with a different type."

You're assigning to a variable whose type `A` matches `B` but they both have a property whose type is incompatible with each other. For example:

```ts
interface Foo {
  {0}: string
}
interface Bar {
  {0}: number
}
const foo: Foo = { value: "" }
const bar: Bar = foo
```

Types `Foo` and `Bar` are structurally equal because they have the same properties. However, they're incompatible because the type of property `{0}` is `string` in `Foo` and `number` in `Bar`.
