'ts-error-translator': minor

Removed the 'contribute' button, and added a 'request translation' button.

From Matt - I wanted to ensure that all the translations on the vscode extension were high-quality and of one voice, but I ended up not having enough time to edit the translations that came in.

I think it's a cleaner flow to let folks simply request translations, and I can provide them - instead of going through multiple review rounds discussing corrections.
