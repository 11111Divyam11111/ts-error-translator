# Getting Started

Clone this repo and run `yarn` to install, then `yarn dev` to run the `next` app.

## Adding/editing translations

Add/edit translations at to the `packages/engine/errors`. Each markdown file must have an `excerpt` - see the existing errors for examples.

Each error must be named with its code: `<code>.md`. To find the code for the error you're looking for, have a look inside `tsErrorMessages.json`, or check the console.

## Prepare for bugs!

Prepare for bugs, y'all. This is by no means a finished product - just got back from my holiday and posting early due to interest. Feel free to have a poke about and improve things!
